    - Auto-detect tv / mobile and activate low performance mode by default
    - Consider implementing more complex logic
        - Based on FPS?
        - Downgrade if FPS is 1?
    - Determine activation timing
        - Only 10 seconds on start?
        - Or always?

    - add a 'low performance' or something like that settings
        - limit our most-performance heavy settings
        - some way to cap the performance hit
    - do we optimize anything
    - have 3 modes of settings
        - high medium and low
        - the 'random' button to still work
    - for high
        - don't want any changes or optimizations that could change the quality
